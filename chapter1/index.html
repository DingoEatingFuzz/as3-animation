# Bitmap Detection

This was a fun one! In the book, this is a good opening exercise since the hitTest logic is built into Flash's `Bitmap` API. This isn't the case in HTML5 (it's par for the course for HTML5 to have the primitives in place but none of the niceities). So that meant implementing a lot more code than I should have had to, but at the same time learning a lot about offscreen canvases and getting an opportunity to play with typed arrays.
